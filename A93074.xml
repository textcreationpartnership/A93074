            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Relation of the manner of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Inſtallation of the Noble Order of <hi>St. George,</hi> at <hi>Windſore,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BEfore I Come of ſpeak of the Statutes of this noble Order, it will be neceſſary to acquaint the Reader with it's Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the occaſion of it's Inſtitution. The Founder of it was <hi>Edward</hi> the third King of <hi>England,</hi> a perſon of a moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht Virtue, the Thunderbolt of War, and in times of Peace nothing inferiour to any Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker of the beſt ages ſo much celebrated. This moſt excellent Prince, the Glory of his times, and a chief Ornament of Europe, having exceedingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed both againſt the French and Scottiſh Kings, diſcomforted their Armies and taken one of them in Perſon, ordained this moſt Noble Order and ſociety of Knights, ſo to adorn their Valour, manifeſted in the Warres with honor the reward of Virtue. There number 26. no more <hi>ut pretium faciat raritas,</hi> leaſt being elſe communicated unto many it might at laſt become deſpicable, nor ever have our Kings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the number, but ſtill confined themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the firſt intention of the Founder. For the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119381:3"/>of its Inſtitution it is generally received that it took beginning from a Garter of the Queen, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Joan</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> a Lady of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Beauty which fell from her as ſhe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and the King taking it up from the ground, a number of Nobles and Gentlemen ſtanding by laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at it, The King ſaid that ſhortly it ſhould come to paſs that Garter ſhould be in high Honor, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation: adding withall theſe words in French <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Soit qui maly penſe,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Shame be to him that evill thinks.</hi> Which after was the Motto, or Impreſs of the Garter. Which were it ſo (ſaith Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi>) it needs not ſeem to be a baſe originall thereof, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering as one ſaith <hi>Nobilitas ſub amore jacet,</hi> He adds withall that ſome report how from his own Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, given forth as a ſignall of a battail which ſpeed ſo fortunatly, he called them Knights of the Garter. But whatſoever the occaſion was, likely it is that it took this name from the blew Garter, which the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of it weare on their left leg: carrying the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Impreſs wrought with Golden Letters, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with precious ſtones and faſtened with a Buckle of Gold, as with the bond of moſt inward ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in token of Unity and Concord, that ſo there might be a Communion as it were of Virtues and good will among them. Dr. <hi>Cowel</hi> reports in his Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he hath ſeen an antient Monument wherein it doth appear that this moſt Noble Order is a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Corporation, having a Common Seal conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of the Kings of England as Soveraigns thereof or chief Guardians of it 25 Knight fellows (as they call them or Companions) of the Garter 14 Canons Reſident being Secular Prieſts, 13 Vicars or Chorall
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119381:3"/>Prieſts, and 26 of the inferiour ſort of Gentry, Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary men commonly called Poor Knights of <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore</hi> (whereof indeed there are but twelve) There belongs alſo to this Heroick Order the Prelate of the Garter which is the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Winton</hi> for the time being; a Chancellor, a Regiſter thereof which alwaies is the Dean of <hi>Windſore,</hi> An Uſher which is one of the Uſhers of the Kings Chamber called the Black rod, and laſt of all a Chief Herauld, even the moſt principall of all; <hi>Garter</hi> firſt King at Arms, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by that Victorious Prince King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, to attend Chiefly on this Order, and to do them ſervice at their Funerals.</p>
            <p>A brief View of ſome of the Statutes of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, The Kings of <hi>England</hi> are (as I ſaid before) the Soveraignes of this Noble Order, and either do in perſon or by their lawfull Deputies by them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated and appointed, elect the Fellows of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Solemnize the Feſtivals, and hold the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. To them it alſo appertains to have the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, reformation, and diſpoſition of the Laws and ſtatutes of the ſaid moſt Noble Order. Which Laws and ſtatutes were firſt Inſtituted and deviſed by the Victorious Prince King <hi>Edward,</hi> of that name the third; after reviſed and ratified by many of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Kings. And on the Reformation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on much altered by King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt. About this time (ſaith Sir <hi>John Hayward</hi> in his Hiſtory of this Prince) the Order was almoſt wholly altered as by the ſtatutes thereof then made doth appear. A thing not to be wondered at, for even the Laws of the moſt ſetled States and Kingdoms have been often changed and varied according to occaſion and the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119381:4"/>Princes pleaſure. Unto them alſo to the Soveraigns, I mean, or to their Deputies, it appertains to choſe and nominate into the Order whom they eſteem to be moſt worthy of that Honor, and like to be the greateſt Ornaments unto it. Yet ſo that ſix at leaſt of the ſaid Fellows do conveene at the Election, and concurre in it, the reſidue of them being all war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be there preſent, and ſuch as faile of their attendance without juſt cauſe, ſuch as the Soveraign ſhall approve, to be amerced. In their Elections two things there are which they eſpecially obſerv.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the Party nominated, be a Gentleman of Name, and Arms; for three deſcents both by the Fathers ſide, and the Mothers ſide. For which cauſe when the Garter was reproachfully taken from the Lord <hi>William Pagit,</hi> by <hi>Dudly</hi> of <hi>Northumberland</hi> to give to <hi>John</hi> his Eldeſt ſon, the Earl of <hi>Warwick:</hi> he uſed this colour to diſguiſe that foule diſhonor; that the ſaid Lord, (as the firſt raiſer of his houſe) was ſaid to be no Gentleman of blood, neither by father nor mother, as Sir <hi>John Heyward</hi> tels the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be obſerved is that the party nominated be without ſpot or foul reproach: as <hi>viz:</hi> not convict of Hereſy; nor attaint of Treaſon; nor by his Prodigality and Riot decayed in his Eſtate, by means whereof he is not able to conſerve the Honor of his Order; nor ſuch a one as ever fled in the day of Battail; his Soveraign Lord, or his Lieutenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the field. In all which caſes a Knight Elected, and Inſtalled may alſo if it pleaſe the Soveraigne, be degraded.</p>
            <p>The Party choſen by the Prince, if he be a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119381:4"/>is certified thereof ſoon after by letters from the Soveraign: and many times the Statutes of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der have been ſent unto him to conſider of them, whether or no he will accept of this Election. But this is a matter meerly formal; for commonly our Kings are firſt well aſſured of the Parties good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them, before they chooſe him: and as for Soveraign Princes it is a true note of <hi>Mr. Cambdens,</hi> that the moſt mighty of them have reputed it their chiefeſt Honour to be choſen and admitted into this Company. If he accept it (as no queſtion but he will) then doth the Soveraign forthwith ſend unto him by his Ambaſſadour and the chief Herald (commonly) the whole Habit of the Order, with the Garter and the Collar wherewith they do inveſt him. And on the other ſide, the Prince or Stranger ſo inveſted, within convenient time, ſend their ſufficient Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with a Mantle of blew Velvet, to be inſtalled in their room at St. GEORGE'S Church in <hi>Winſore.</hi> But if the party choſen be a Subject of the Kingdom, the Garter is delivered to him preſently upon his Election, to ſignifie that he is choſe into the Order. Afterwards in the Chapter-houſe, upon the reading of his Commiſſion before the Soveraign or his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, he is inveſted with the Robe and with the Hood. Then follows the Inſtallment, performed with many grave and magnificent Ceremonies: which done, he doth receive the Collar of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. This at their Inſtallations have alwayes an Oath adminiſtrated, that to their power, during the time they ſhall be fellows of the Order, they ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Honour, Quarrels, Rights and Lordſhips, of the Soveraign, and that they ſhall indeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119381:5"/>the Honour of the ſaid Order: and all the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of it they ſhall well obſerve, without fraud or covin. Which Oath is by the Natives of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom taken abſolutely, and in terms; but many times by Strangers relatively and by halfes, in reference to ſome former Order.</p>
            <p>So when King <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France,</hi> was by the Earl of <hi>Darby</hi> inveſted with the Garter, <hi>Anno</hi> 1585. he took his Oath to keep the Statutes of the Order in all points, wherein they were not oppoſite to the Order of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to which he had been ſworn before. Upon which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo <hi>Frederick</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> though he did joyfully accept the habit of the Order, refuſed to take the Oath at all, becauſe he had been ſworn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (at his Inſtallation in the Order of St. <hi>Michael</hi>) to the King of <hi>France.</hi> Being thus ſolemnly inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ſeated in the place belonging to them in the Chap<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>el, their next care is to faſten an Eſcotcheon of their Arms and Hachments, in a plate of mettal, upon the back of their ſaid Stalls, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move according as themſelves in Order are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced higher. And in that order they do alſo change the places of their Banners, Swords and Helmets, which are continually ſet over their ſaid Stalls, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their being of the Order. This only is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that at the death of any of the Knights of this moſt Noble Order, their plate of Arms is left for ever to that Stall, where laſt they ſat, to preſerve their memory: whereas the Banner, Sword and Helmet, are all taken down, and offered with all due ſolemnities, the Offerings made by ſuch of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving Knights, as by the Soveraign ſhall be deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119381:5"/>to that ſervice. I ſaid before that they remove their Plates, and Hachments, according as themſelves in order are advanced higher in this Order, they take place according to the antiquity of their Creation, and not according to their Dignities, Titles, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, ſo that ſometimes a Knight Bachelour hath place before an Earl or Baron, as not long ſince we had example in Sir <hi>Harry Lea</hi> Knight, keeper of the Armory. Only in Honour unto Strangers which be Dukes, or ſons and brethren unto forrein Kings and Princes, it is permitted that they take their rooms and places according to their quality.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have ſpoken of the Election of Saint GEORGE'S Knights and their admiſſion to the Order. A little would be ſaid now of the means and wayes whereby their rooms are void, and their places deſtitute: and they are three: For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are void by Death, or by Degradation, or by Ceſſion and ſurrendry. The ſecond of theſe (for we wil not ſpeak of Death) is Degradation, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> piece of Juſtice more to be commended where it may not, than where it may be ſpared. The Caſes wherein Degradation is allowed of, I have already ſhewn, but the examples are but few. <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Paget</hi> which was ſo ſcornfully degraded by <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> with great Honour reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red again unto his Order. And Sir <hi>John Faſtolfe,</hi> which for his valiantneſſe had been elected of the Order, was by the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> under whom he ſerved, and unto whom he was great Maſter of the Houſhold, diveſted in great anger, of his George and Garter: becauſe he had departed from a Battel (which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> loſt) without ſtroke ſtricken:

The third and laſt means of avoidance, is by Ceſſion or ſurrendry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and here of the examples are alſo very few.

               <hi>Windſore,</hi> the faireſt and moſt ſtately of our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Palaces, was by King <hi>Edward</hi> who adorned and beautified it, conceived moſt fit to be the ſeat of this moſt excellent Order which he had eſtabliſhed. An houſe indeed worthy of ſuch Inhabitants; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worthily honoured by them: For here they alwayes leave in readineſſe the Mantle of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to be laid up for them, for any ſudden chances
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119381:6"/>which might happen to require their preſence at St: GEORGE'S Chappel, or in the Chapter-houſe: Here do they ſolemnize the Inſtallations of their brethren, and perform their obſequies. And laſtly, ſuch a reverend regard they owe the place, that if they come within two miles of it (except that they be hindred by ſome weighty and important buſineſs) they alwayes do repair thereto, and putting on their Mantles, which are their in readineſſe, proceed unto the Chappel, and there make their offerings. Nor do they go at any time from out the Caſtle, if their occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions bring them thither, till they have offered in like manner.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſpoken of the ſtatutes of this moſt Noble Order whereby they are and have been gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we will deſcend in the next place to give you notice of their Patron, which after the opinions of thoſe times, they choſe unto themſelves. Of which this <hi>Polydore Virgil.</hi> This order is (ſaith he dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto St GEORGE as the chief Saint, and Patron of the men of War; whoſe Feſtivall they therefore ſolemnly obſerve with many noble Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. But what need <hi>Polidore</hi> have been produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto this purpoſe, ſince from the Charter of the Inſtitution we have a teſtimony more authenticall. For there King <hi>Edward</hi> tels us that to the Honor of Almighty God, and of the Bleſſed Virgin St. <hi>Mary,</hi> and of the Glorious Martyr St. GEORGE, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of the Right Noble Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and to the Exaltation of the Holy Catholick Faith, he had ordained, eſtabliſhed, created and founded within his Caſtle of <hi>Windſore,</hi> a Company of twenty ſix Noble Knights to be of the ſaid moſt Noble Order
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119381:7"/>of St. GEORGE, named the Garter. It is true indeed what <hi>Polidor</hi> hath well obſerved, with how great Ceremony and Solemnity the Knights do Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate this Feaſt: Attending both on the Veſper, and the day it ſelf at Divine Service, attired in the moſt rich and ſtately Mantels of the Order: and gallantly adorned with their moſt rich and ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Collars (which we call of <hi>SS.</hi>) The Image of St. GEORGE, garniſhed with pearls and precious ſtones, appendant to them. In which their going to the Church, and in their ſitting at the Table, they go and ſet by two and two, every one with his fellow which is fore againſt him in his ſtall. And if by chance it happen that his Fellow be not preſent he doth both go and ſet alone, I ſay if it chance to happen: for all the Fellows are obliged to be there perſonally preſent, without a juſt and reaſonable cauſe acceptable to the Soveraigne or his Deputy, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>nified by ſpeciall letters of Excuſe. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pompe and Rich magnificence of this Feaſt I forbear to mention, as being unable to expreſs it. The mind is then beſt ſatisfied in ſuch things as this, when the eye hath ſeen them. But I proceed unto St. GEORGE, of which their Patron, and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Order it ſelf, the Marriage of the <hi>Thame,</hi> and <hi>Iſis,</hi> and Poem written ſome years ſince, doth thus deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</p>
